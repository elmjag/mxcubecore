# sample_changer.Sample.Sample

Represents a mountable sample or a sample slot in a container.

This is typically a pin holding a protein crystal.
The pin is mechanically compatible with sample container and diffractometer head.
A beamline will normally have a sample changing robot.
The robot is able to move sample pins from sample containers to the diffractometer and return them back.

## LIMS integration

MxCube supports synchronization of sample's meta-data with a [LIMS](glossary.md) system.
LIMS are used to manage available samples in the sample changer and to track preformed data collections for samples.

sample address, meta-data, scan-able samples
